Task 6 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project is part of my AI & ML internship and focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset.

🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

 ✅ What I Did
- Loaded the Iris dataset
- Normalized features using StandardScaler
- Trained KNN model with different values of K
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized decision boundary in 2D

 📊 Output
- Best value of K selected based on accuracy
- Model performance report
- 2D decision boundary plot
